# Treasury / Gasless Purchases

# Notes for gasless purchases:
# 1) The server wallet (PRIVATE_KEY) pays gas to call purchaseItemFor(), so fund it with MON.
# 2) Set the treasury address on GameIntermediary (owner-only).
# 3) Mint TURBO to the treasury address.
# 4) Approve GameIntermediary to spend TURBO from the treasury (use scripts/mintAndBuyAll.js with --treasury-approve).
